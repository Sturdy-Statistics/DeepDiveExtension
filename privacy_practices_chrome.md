Processes all data locally and only sends your current page’s URL to sturdystatistics.com when you click the “Deep Dive” button — no tracking, no storage.

# Chrome Web Store – Privacy Practices

## What information does the extension collect?

We access the current page’s URL and, for Google Search, the search query — only to detect supported sites and build a Sturdy Statistics analysis link.

## How is my information used?

All processing happens locally in your browser. 
The only time any data is sent to our servers is when you click the “Deep Dive” button, at which point your URL or query is sent to sturdystatistics.com to open your requested analysis. 
We do not store or share this data.

## Does the extension track me or run in the background?

No. It only runs on supported sites and does not collect data when inactive.

## Permissions explained:

* *Active Tab / Site Access:* Detect supported sites and read the current page’s URL.
* *Scripting:* Display the Deep Dive button on supported pages.
