# Privacy Policy – Sturdy Statistics Deep Dive Extension

**Effective date:** 2025-08-15

## Overview

The **Sturdy Statistics Deep Dive** browser extension adds a “Deep Dive” button to certain supported websites — including Google Search, arXiv, DOI.org, Semantic Scholar, and PubMed — allowing you to quickly open those pages in a Sturdy Statistics analysis view. 
Holding the "f" key while clicking activates “fast mode.”

We take your privacy seriously. 
This extension processes all data locally in your browser, and only sends data to our servers when you explicitly click the button.

## Information We Access

To function, the extension may access:
* The current webpage URL (to detect supported sites)
* Search query parameters from Google search URLs
* Page location information to determine whether to display the Deep Dive button

We do not:
* Collect or store your browsing history.
* Collect personal data such as your name, email address, or IP address.
* Use cookies or trackers.

## When Data Is Sent to Our Servers

The extension only sends data to our servers when you click the “Deep Dive” button.
* The current page’s URL or search query is sent to `sturdystatistics.com` to open the requested analysis page.
* No personal identifiers are attached.
* We do not store or retain this data after fulfilling the request

## Data Storage and Sharing

* **Local Processing**: All detection and button display happen entirely within your browser.
* **No Storage**: The extension does not store or save any of your data, either locally or remotely.
* **No Background Collection**: No data is collected when you are not on a supported site, and no background tracking occurs.
* **No Third-Party Sharing**: We do not share your information with any third parties.

## Third-Party Services

When you click the button, you will be directed to sturdystatistics.com. 
That site has its own privacy policy.

## Permissions Explained
* **Active Tab / Access your data for specific sites**: Needed to detect supported sites and read the current page’s URL.
* **Scripting / Content Scripts**: Used to insert the Deep Dive button into supported pages.

## Changes to This Policy
If we change this privacy policy, we will update the “Effective date” above and publish the new version in our extension listings.
